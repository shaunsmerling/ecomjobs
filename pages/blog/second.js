            These are questions that inevitably come up when you start thinking about how to connect the dots between what you’re selling and who you’re trying to reach. You can check our guide on how to start a business to get started.

Whether you’ve got nothing but a business idea or want to pivot your existing branding design, here’s what you need to know about building a strong brand identity for your business.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold"> What is a brand? </h2>
            <br></br>
              <div className="text-xl">
              A brand isn’t just a recognizable name and brand logo that distinguishes you in a crowded market. Your brand is how people perceive you wherever they interact with your business—both the impressions you can control and the ones you can’t.When you think about it, people have personal brands, too. We each have a name, a face, a style, and a way of communicating, and with these traits, we make different impressions on different people.

Likewise, businesses have names, products, logos, colors, fonts, voices, and reputations that make up what they are and affect how they’re perceived.

You can’t effectively approach how to create a brand without being consistent and maintaining that consistency as you extend your brand to every part of your business. The best way to build a brand starts with establishing what that consistency is going to look like and the feeling you want it to evoke.

            <div className="text-xl">
            While you might revisit some steps as you pivot or create your brand, it’s important that you consider each aspect as you shape your brand identity. 

Let’s start by laying the groundwork to inform how to build your business brand.
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold"> 1. Research your target audience and your competitors </h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            Before you start making any decisions about how to create a business brand, you need to understand the current market, i.e., who your potential customers and current competitors are.
There are many ways to do this:
<br></br>
<br></br>
- Google your product or service category and analyze the direct and indirect competitors that come up.
<br></br>
- Check subreddits that relate to your customers and eavesdrop on their conversations and product recommendations.
<br></br>
- Talk to people who are part of your target market and ask them what brands they buy from in your space.
<br></br>
- Look at the relevant social media accounts or pages your target audience follows and are receptive to.
<br></br>
- Go shopping online or offline and get a feel for how your customers would browse and buy products.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<span className="font-bold">As you go about your research, make a note of:</span>
<br>
</br>
<br></br>
1. Who your “lowest hanging fruit” customers are—the ones you could most easily sell to
<br></br>
2. Who your top-of-mind competitors are—the brands that are established and known in the market
<br></br>
3. How your customers speak and what they talk about—the interests they have and the language they express them in
<br></br>
<br></br>
It’s important to have a handle on this before moving forward, as it will inform what your brand should focus on and how it can position itself apart from competitors.
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold"> 2. Pick your focus and personality </h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            You can’t establish your brand to be everything to everyone, especially at the start.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

It’s important to find your focus and let that inform all the other parts of your brand as you build it.
<br></br>
<br></br>

Here are some questions and branding exercises to get you thinking about the focus and tone of your brand.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold"> What's your positioning statement? </h2>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<span className="font-bold">Your positioning statement should go something like...</span>
<br></br>
<br></br>
We offer [PRODUCT/SERVICE] for [TARGET MARKET] to [VALUE PROPOSITION].
<br></br>
<br></br>
Unlike [THE ALTERNATIVE], we [KEY DIFFERENTIATOR].
<br></br>
<br></br>
For example: We offer water bottles to help hikers stay hydrated, while reducing their carbon footprint. Unlike other water bottle brands, we plant a tree for every bottle you buy.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Your unique value proposition is the one thing you’re competing on. Find it, go in on it, and make it a part of your brand's messaging.
<br></br>
<br></br>

Alternatively, if the company you want to start has a cause at its core (e.g., if you’re starting a social enterprise), you can also write this out as a mission statement that makes a clear promise to your customers or to the world.
</div>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">What words would you associate with your brand? </h2>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<div className="text-xl">
One way to look at how to build your brand is to imagine your brand as a person. What would they be like? What kind of personality would your customers be attracted to?

This will help inform your voice on social media and the tone of all your creative, both visual and written.

A fun and useful exercise for how to create a new brand is pitching three to five adjectives that describe the type of brand that might resonate with your audience. I compiled this list of traits to help you get started.
</div>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold"> 3. Choose your business name </h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            What’s in a brand name? Depending on the kind of business you want to start, you can make the case that your name matters very little or it matters a lot.

As we’ve said before, a brand is so much more than a name. The personality, actions, and reputation of your brand identity are really what give the name meaning in the market.

But as a small business owner, your company’s name is probably one of the first big commitments you have to make. It’ll impact your brand logo, your domain, your marketing, and your trademark registration, if you decide to go that route (it’s harder to trademark generic brand names that literally describe what you sell).

Ideally, you want a store name that’s hard to imitate and even harder to confuse with existing players in the market. If you have plans to expand the product lines you offer down the road, consider keeping your business name broad so that it’s easier to pivot, rather than choosing a brand name based on your product category.

You can use our free business name generator to brainstorm some names, or try one (or a combination) of the following approaches:
<br></br>
<br></br>
-Make up a word, like Pepsi.
<br></br>
-Reframe an unrelated word, like Apple for computers.
<br></br>
-Use a suggestive word or metaphor, like Buffer.
<br></br>
-Describe it literally (caution: easy to imitate), like The Shoe Company.
<br></br>
-Alter a word by removing letters, adding letters, or using Latin endings, likeTumblr (Tumbler) or Activia.
<br></br>
-Create an acronym from a longer name, like HBO (Home Box Office).
<br></br>
-Combine two words: Pinterest (pin + interest) or Snapple (snappy + apple)
<br></br>
<br></br>
Since your brand name will also affect the domain/URL of your website, be sure to shop around to see what’s available before deciding on a domain name for your brand. 
</div>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">4. Write a slogan</h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">

            A catchy slogan is a nice-to-have asset—something brief and descriptive you can use as a tagline in your social media bios, website header, custom business cards, and anywhere else where you only have a few words to make a big impact.

Keep in mind that you can always change your slogan as you find new angles for marketing—Pepsi has gone through over 30 slogans in the past few decades. 

A good slogan is short, catchy, and makes a strong impression to boost brand awareness. Here are some ways to approach writing a slogan of your own:
<br></br>
<br></br>

-Stake your claim. Death Wish Coffee: “The World’s Strongest Coffee.”
<br></br>
-Make it a metaphor. Red Bull: “Red Bull gives you wings.” 
<br></br>
-Adopt your customers’ attitude. Nike: “Just do it.”
<br></br>
-Leverage labels. Cards Against Humanity: “A party game for horrible people.”
<br></br>
-Write a rhyme. Folgers coffee: “The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup.”
<br></br>
-Describe it literally. Aritzia: “Everyday luxury to elevate your world.”

            </div>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">5. Choose the look of your brand (colors and font)</h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            
            Once you’ve got a name down, you’ll need to think about your brand design—how you’ll visually represent your brand—namely your colors and typography. This will come in handy when you start to use a website builder to make your own website.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Choosing your colors </h2>
<br></br>
Colors don’t just define the look of your brand, they also convey the feeling you want to communicate and help you make it consistent across everything you do. You’ll want to choose colors that differentiate you from direct competitors to avoid confusing your potential customers.

Color psychology isn’t an exact science, but it does help to inform the choices you make, especially when it comes to the color you pick for your brand logo.

The infographic below offers a nice overview of the emotions and associations that different colors generally evoke.
<br></br>
<img className="object-cover w-full py-10" src="/colorgraph.jpeg" alt=""/>
<br></br>
Consider how legible white and black text will be over your color palette and how colored text might look over white and black backgrounds. Try using a tool like Coolors to brainstorm colors that work together. Grab the hex codes to keep handy, and sift through different shades to find the ones you like.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Choosing your font</h2>
<br></br>
At this point, it’s also good to look at fonts you might want to use on your website.

The best way to build a brand when it comes to fonts is by keeping it simple. Pick two fonts at most to avoid confusing visitors: one for headings and one for body text (this doesn’t include the font you might use in your brand logo). 

You can use Fontpair to browse from a wide selection of fonts that go well together.
<img className="object-cover w-full py-10" src="/fontpair.jpeg" alt=""/>
</div> 
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">6. Design your brand logo</h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            A brand logo design is probably one of the first things that come to mind when you think about building a new brand. And for good reason: it’s the face of your company, after all, and could potentially be everywhere your brand is.

Ideally, you’ll want to create your brand with a logo that’s unique, identifiable, and scalable to work at all sizes (something often overlooked).

Consider all the places where your brand’s logo needs to exist: 
<br></br>
<br></br>

-Website 
<br></br>
-Social media profile picture 
<br></br>
-Product packaging
<br></br>
-Video ads
<br></br>
-YouTube channel banner 
<br></br>
-Favicon (the tiny icon that identifies your open browser tabs)
<br></br>

If you have a text logo as your Instagram avatar, for example, it’ll be almost impossible to read. To make your life easier, create a square version of your brand logo with an icon or symbol element (called a logomark) that remains recognizable even at smaller sizes.

Invest in a logo that can appear anywhere around the web and in physical print. 

Notice how the Walmart logo has both the “sparks” icon and the wordmark, which can be used together or separately.

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">7. Apply your branding across your business</h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            Applying your branding across your business gives it a cohesive brand story. A brand story represents “who” your business is and what it stands for. It sets the stage for every interaction customers have with your brand, in-store and online.

In Shopify’s research on what wins buyer and customer trust, we found that buyers shopping on an online store for the first time often look for a business’s mission and purpose to see if they share any values with the business (e.g., sustainability). They will turn to its About Us page to learn more about who they’re buying from and, for more socially conscious customers, how the business is run. If your business has a brand story, share it, because it can help the shopper feel reassured yours is a legitimate business. 

When building a new brand, your positioning statement can get you started, but you’ll want to ask yourself a few questions to nail your brand story:
<br></br>
<br></br>
1.What motivated me to start my business? 
<br></br>
2.Why does this company exist?
<br></br> 
3.How do we contribute to the world?
<br></br>
4.What is the story behind my business the customer should know?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Not every business is mission-driven, but if you create your brand with a mission or values at its core, share your brand story and tell customers why the business was started. Look at the businesses TOMS and Coca-Cola, the first a mission-driven brand, the second not so much.

TOMS, a footwear and accessories company, is “in business to improve lives.” TOMS earned its strong reputation as a social enterprise with a charitable program called One for One, where it donated shoes to children in need. Customer could feel good about every purchase they made with TOMS.

Your brand story can evolve over time, as it did for TOMS, expanding beyond giving shoes, to giving a third of its profits to grassroots organizations focused on sustainable change.

Coca-Cola, a globally recognized soft drink business, may have corporate social responsibility initiatives, but its brand isn’t grounded in a strong social good or environmental mission. Instead, it appeals to its target market through branding that tells the story of bringing together friends to experience fun, happiness, and connection.

A customer of a Coca-Cola product can walk away feeling as if they are more socially connected with friends or loved ones if they enjoy the products together.

For business owners building a new brand, there’s a lot to learn from Coca-Cola. It offers up excellent examples of brand marketing through timeless designs, fonts, images, and colors that are instantly recognizable.

Whether or not the best way to build a brand for you involves focusing on a mission, give your customers a story to tell themselves and others about your brand.
