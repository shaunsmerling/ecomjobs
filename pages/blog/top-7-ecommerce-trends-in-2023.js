            Since the pandemic, e-commerce trends have changed, and with many brick-and-mortar stores going online to remain in business, e-commerce is one trend that must be utilized to succeed online.
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            The reason for this trend is not farfetched: 91% of the global population owns a smartphone, and 45% shop from their phones. In the US, 77% of adults own a phone, and 1/3 of US internet users make an online purchase weekly. As of August 2022, mobile devices made up 62% of web traffic.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold"> Chatbots in E-commerce</h2>
            <br></br>
           

            <div className="text-xl">
            Humans cannot be available throughout the day and cannot deliver the swift response that customers need when in trouble. As online shopping increases, consumers want a simple method that support, aid, and assist them effectively. The chatbot will generate over $100 billion in 2023, and Insider Intelligence predicts that consumer interaction with chatbots in e-commerce will reach $124 billion by 2024.
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            Additionally, customers accept and interact with chatbots, and they have now become valuable business tools, boosting response rate up to 40% and simplifying the consumer’s frustration. Chatbots are becoming sophisticated and will be a trust and money-saving component for e-commerce businesses.
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold"> Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Video </h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            The e-commerce space is evolving, and anything that will make customers more satisfied and loyal to a brand is welcome. While 94% of shoppers agree to use AR for shopping and 67% of advertising agencies incorporate it, there is a booming market for it in 2023. 
Furthermore, 100 million consumers, or 61%, say they will shop from brands that incorporate augmented reality. The market projections look good, with $50 billion in 2024 to meet online shoppers’ needs. Augmented reality is the real deal and enables the customer to visualize a product in 3D from the comfort of their homes. The benefits of AR cannot be overemphasized as it gives consumers a sneak preview of what it would look like in your space when you make the purchase. If your business is already using video ads, 2023 is the best time to incorporate AR and win over a tech-savvy demographic.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            Virtual reality is another creative trend for e-commerce in 2023 and beyond. Customers would love to see the products or services offered beforehand, and VR technology bridges this gap by giving consumers a better shopping experience before payment. According to eMarketer, there are 57.4 million VR users in the US. The number is said to jump to 95 million in 2022 according to Business Insider.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Virtual reality, Augmented Reality, and Video messaging are the holy grail of e-commerce in 2023, and beyond, as the industry changes, it needs the appropriate technology to bridge the brand-consumer gap and deliver satisfaction without breaking the bank. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Consumer content in local languages </h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            English is the predominate online language for many consumers, but there are countries that want to make purchases but do not understand English. Brands that want to maintain a wider audience should gladly produce content in foreign languages to accommodate more customers. According to global consumer research, 65% of online shoppers prefer content in their language, and 40% will not shop from websites that do not have their language option.
Brands that opt for this option in 2023 and beyond should focus on the product description, reviews, and checkout process; these are three areas consumers are likely to check before making a purchase.
</div>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Flexible and better payment options and processing
</h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">

            Cart abandonment is palpable and heartbreaking, and for retailers, any tools able to curb it would make a tangible addition to the industry. Furthermore, the main reason for cart abandonment is a rigid and complex payment process.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Your payment process is the last step of an online shopper’s experience, and whether you like it or not, a quality checkout procedure is the best conversion tool. For brands and retailers that deal on a global scale, a local payment option ensures that sales are completed without third parties or complicated systems. Today, there are simplified payment options available that help customers enjoy checkout processes. Furthermore, a new approach where the customer can buy now and pay later is a strategy to keep customers returning and eliminate abandoned carts.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">What does 2023 hold for the e-commerce industry?</h2>
            <br></br>
            <div className="text-xl">
            
            The future is bright, and the tools for success are numerous and accessible to anyone that wants to build a sustainable online business. Whether you want to satisfy your customer or increase sales, 2023 has productive trends to make the journey seamless and profitable. The growth of e-commerce means more opportunities to enable brands to interact with old, new, and skeptical consumers and meet their unique needs and preferences.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Conclusion </h2>
<br></br>
One of the challenges of running a successful e-commerce store in 2023 will be helping customers interact with their products and services. We have seen 7 trends, including 
Green consumerism consists of consumers who are earth conscious and want to save the planet in their own little way.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Data privacy and multichannel marketing – people want to trust that information about them is safe and that you can guarantee that customers will come. However, consumers are tired of dull marketing approaches, and multichannel options provide vibrancy.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Chatbots, VR, AR, and Video – technology controls this space, so the earlier you indulge in it, the better.
